 * New: added support for Maven (ms)

2011-11-07

 * New: TreeLayout can either use "equality" (equals(...), the default) or "identity" (==) when comparing tree nodes 
   * consider using "identity" when your node objects override "equals" and two nodes in the tree may be "equal" according to the new equals definition.
   * "Identity" can be selected through a new parameter in the TreeLayout constructor.
